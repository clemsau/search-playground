  <h1>Search & Information Retrieval Playground</h1>
  <p>Interactive demonstrations of how search engines match your queries to relevant documents</p>
</div>

<div class="intro-section">
  <h2>Understanding Search</h2>
  <p>
    Every day, we rely on search engines to find information in vast collections of documents. Whether it's searching
    the web,
    finding an email in your inbox, or looking up a product in an online store, the fundamental challenge is the same:
    <strong>how do we identify the most relevant documents for a given query?</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    This playground explores the core algorithms that power search systems, from traditional keyword-based approaches
    to modern semantic search techniques. Each demo is interactive—you can modify queries and documents to see exactly
    how different ranking algorithms work under the hood.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="intro-section">
  <h2>The Two Paradigms of Search</h2>

  <h3>Keyword-Based Search</h3>
  <p>
    Traditional search systems rely on <strong>lexical matching</strong>—they look for overlapping words between your
    query
    and documents. The key insight is that not all words are equally important. A document that mentions "quantum"
    repeatedly
    when most documents don't is probably more relevant for a query about "quantum physics" than one that just happens
    to
    use the word "the" many times.
  </p>

  <p>
    Algorithms like <strong>TF-IDF</strong> and <strong>BM25</strong> formalize this intuition by balancing term
    frequency
    (how often a word appears in a document) against document frequency (how common that word is across all documents).
    BM25 goes further by addressing issues like term saturation and document length normalization.
  </p>

  <h3>Semantic Search</h3>
  <p>
    Modern search systems go beyond simple keyword matching by understanding <strong>meaning</strong>. Vector search
    represents
    queries and documents as high-dimensional vectors, where similar concepts live close together in vector space. This
    allows
    the system to find documents that are semantically related to your query, even if they don't share exact words.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, a search for "machine learning" might return documents about "neural networks" or "artificial
    intelligence"
    because these concepts are embedded near each other in the vector space.
  </p>

  <h2>Explore the Algorithms</h2>

    Three interactive demos to help you understand how these algorithms work in practice. Each demo lets you
    edit queries and documents, adjust parameters, and see the results in real-time.

      <h3>TF-IDF</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency</strong> is the foundation of keyword-based search.
        See how it identifies important terms by balancing how often words appear in a document against how rare
        they are across your entire collection.

      <h3>BM25</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Best Matching 25</strong> improves on TF-IDF with term frequency saturation and document length
        normalization. Experiment with the k1 and b parameters to see how they affect ranking in different scenarios.
